## What I do

In my current role as a Corporate Accountant I have had the opportunity to expand on my foundations while improving my ability as an Accountant. 

At Accor Apartments and Leases I am responsible for the preparation of several P&Ls and Balance sheets across multiple shared services departments. I give advice to management and executives on how best to control costs and ensure the best possible outcome for their departments. 

We’re currently Closing month end in two days. We use Microsoft Dynamics GP and Calumo in order to meet these demands. I have experience using other large ERP software like IMB’s AS400 and MYOB.

I also assist with the supervision of four assistant accountants, providing professional guidance and advice on accounting standards and procedures.

In my previous role I have assisted with the rapid expansion of Stratco and specifically handled the challenge of adapting a newly acquired business to the reporting standards that were required. This Involved not only moving factory locations but also facilitating in the migration of one ERP to another.
