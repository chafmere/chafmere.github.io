Recently I became interested in creating my own website to give people another way to see who I am and get into contact with me. I had managed to get a free domain name through a promotion with Ventra IP, so I just needed a way to host a website, and I needed to figure about how to make a website.

I have a habit of wanting to figure out a way of doing things on my own, without handing over money for something that I could learn anyway. I went on a google deep dive and found that you can host websites on Git hub for free and use a custom domain. But the catch? You have to make the website yourself
